We developed a meditation application tailored for patients dealing with headaches, with guidance from a neurologist. <br>
This application offers behavioral therapy through a variety of meditation techniques to aid in headache management. Patients can also track their headaches and painkiller usage. Furthermore, we've incorporated a dedicated interface for doctors, allowing them to monitor their patients by utilizing individualized identification keys.<br> <br><br>
